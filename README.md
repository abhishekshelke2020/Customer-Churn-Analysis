# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to understand why customers leave and what factors impact retention. Using customer-level data, I built an interactive dashboard to track churn patterns across contract types, tenure, services, and monthly charges.

The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total customers, churn rate, and churned customers, and breaks them down by tenure bands, contract type, online security, and backup services. It also compares average monthly charges for retained vs churned customers to identify pricing-related churn signals.

The goal of this project is to help businesses identify high-risk customer segments and take data-driven actions to improve retention. This dashboard can be used by stakeholders to quickly monitor churn trends and make informed decisions.
